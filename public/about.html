<h1>Adoring Fan </h1>
<p>The Adoring Fan is a young and cheerful Bosmer 
  commoner and a part of the "reward" for becoming 
  Grand Champion in the Arena..</p>

<p>"Wow! You're the Grand Champion! I saw your fight 
  against the Gray Prince! You're the best! Can I... 
  Can I follow you around? I won't get in the way!"</p>

<p>"Here? Right here? What about, say... over there? No? 
  Right here? All right then, you're the Grand Champion! 
  Whatever you say!".</p>
